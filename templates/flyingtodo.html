      This project was made with one word in mind:
      <span class="markblue">Simplicity</span>. From my own experience, I have a
      lot of problems working without a <span class="markblue">guideline</span>.
      Without my ToDo List, I'm getting lost in my own work, forgetting or
      drifting from one task to another.

      <span class="linebreak"></span
      ><span class="markblue">This resolves everything</span> : A simple
      program, without a hundred features that distracts its users, you can tick
      boxes and add tags, <span class="markblue">that's all</span> !

      <span class="bold markblue">This app was a big challenge for me</span>:
      this is my first ever <span class="markblue">electron app</span>. Not
      knowing how to use it was the main problem, but also learning to setup the
      app on the PC side was a challenge. <span class="linebreak"></span>I also
      struggled with <span class="markblue">tags</span> and
      <span class="markblue">code formatting</span>, as the first version's code
      was really messy.

    <p class="singletext">
      Well, there aren't that many solutions: I had to read.
      <span class="linebreak"></span>
      <span class="markblue"> I read the documentation of Electron </span>
      , which, I am lucky, is pretty straight-forward!
      <span class="linebreak"></span>
      It was also a great occasion to use the windows terminal, using commands
      like <span class="markgray">`cd /d`</span> or
      <span class="markgray">`npm run`</span>. I had to install and use
      <span class="markblue">NPM</span>, which taught me about versionning and
      <span class="markblue">git tags</span> !
      <span class="linebreak"></span> For the formatting of code, I had to think
      and learn about transferring a <span class="markblue">forEach</span> item
      to an external function, allowing me to create reusable functions!
      <span class="linebreak"></span> The biggest struggle was with
      <span class="markblue">tags</span>: it wouldn't work, but I finally found
      a solution using forEach and creating small divs inside an item, with an
      ID.

      In the future, I want to continue this app.
      <span class="linebreak"></span> This was made because I have an
      <span class="markblue">objective</span>: I want to code every app of my PC
      myself, so that I won't need other external applications. I want
      <span class="markblue">FlyingToDo</span> to be a sort of "productivity
      hub", like notion, but way more <span class="markblue">simple</span>,
      without paywalls and without a thousand features that distracts its users.
